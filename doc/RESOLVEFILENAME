Pathname Resolution in Tools.Directories.resolveFilename()
----------------------------------------------------------

In all scopes:

"~/" at the start of the base path is replaced by the optional path_prefix 
argument to resolveFilename().  When resolveFilename() is called from the 
skin.readSkin() path_prefix is set to the value of the current screen's 
skin_path attribute if it exists, or the directory of the file containing 
the screen if there is no skin_path attribute.

If the "~/" path prefix is used in a path resolved by resolveFilename() and 
its path_prefix parameter is None, resolveFilename() will raise an 
AssertionError exception.

After that substitution, if the resolved path starts with '/', it is 
returned unchanged.


SCOPE_GUISKIN

    If the path SCOPE_CONFIG/base exists, use that as the resolved name.

    Otherwise if config.skin.primary_skin.value (the skin path selected in
    MENU>Setup>AV Setup>Skin setup) contains '/', use
    SCOPE_SKIN/primary_skin.value/base as the resolved name if the path exists
    or if SCOPE_SKIN/primary_skin.value/base contains ':" and the part of the
    path before the ':' exists.

    Otherwise use SCOPE_SKIN/base as the resolved name if the path exists
    or if SCOPE_SKIN/base contains ':" and the part of the
    path before the ':' exists.

    Otherwise if 'skin_default' is not in SCOPE_SKIN, use
    SCOPE_SKIN/skin_default/base as the resolved name.

    Otherwise fall back to the path SCOPE_SKIN/base.


SCOPE_LCDSKIN

    As for SCOPE_GUISKIN, but search SCOPE_LCDSKIN instead of SCOPE_GUISKIN.


SCOPE_FONTS

    As for SCOPE_GUISKIN, but search both SCOPE_GUISKIN and SCOPE_LCDSKIN 
    before looking in SCOPE_FONTS.


For all other scopes, the base path is appended to the scope's directory.

*1 Current home directory of the enigma2 process, effectively /home/root/
*2 These directories are dynamically calculated based on current Enigma2 
   settings.

If the directory path for the file doesn't exist, the path creation flag
determines what is done:

PATH_CREATE:	 Create the directory path if it doesn't exist.  E.g. if the 
		 resolved path is /etc/enigma2/playlist/playlist1.xml, and 
		 /etc/enigma2/playlist does not exist, then create it.  This 
		 is done using os.makedirs(), so it will try to create all 
		 segments of the pathname.
PATH_DONTCREATE: Don't create the directory if it doesn't exist.
